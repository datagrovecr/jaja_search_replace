# This is where I'm going to add some notes.

## Bugs fixed 
- Deletes all text and substitutes it with found word 10-19



## Progress
- Visual change to the word(s) found with **bold** or all uppercase letters
- added linter code
- Dinos example, helps with state change



## Issues 
- Higlighting the word found 
- Incorporating lint highlight 
- Mxing the linter with code
- Triggering transactions that update the state
- Dropdown menu issues, javascript issue


## Ideas
- Put find code inside a function and call linter when word is found.
